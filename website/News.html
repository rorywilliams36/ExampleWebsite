                <p><span class="text-underline">The Puzzle Room</span> is an website which has be gaining an unexpected amount of popularity in the recent months. The founder, <span class="text-bold">Rory Williams</span> has stated <span class="text-bold text-italic">'The increasing popularity has been caused by the implementation of our new game".</span> The website has seen an increase from an average of 2000 users a month has doubled to 4000, with it peak at 10,000 users at one time which was just over 2 months ago.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This has also caused other rival websites to start popping up which have been following the same success using the same idea. The competition have been seeing mixed but mostly positive results.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The popularity gained has been staggering for such a small website with an evenre smaller team. The website started last year and wasn't able to get 10 different users to use the website for a couple of months. The founder Williams stated that the development team has been working tirelessly and hoping that the website would gain traction somehow.</p>
